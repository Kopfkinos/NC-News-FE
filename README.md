# Red Caret News Front End

- What Is This Project?

This project is a simple frontend interface designed to give me practical experience in building a browser-based web app.

The app replicates the functionality of a simple forum like Reddit, where users can view, rate and comment on articles. It makes requests to an API I developed, which responds with requests from a database I seeded. 

The app is built with React, and tested my skills of component-based app design, state management with hooks, conditional rendering, form handling, and asynchronous data fetching using Axios. 

I also practiced routing with React Router. This project served as a hands-on way to deepen my understanding of building dynamic, user-interactive UIs and integrating them with a backend API.
